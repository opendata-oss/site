      <p>
        Modern cloud databases optimize for vendor economics, not operational
        reality. Hardware is marked up by the cloud, then marked up again by
        database vendors layered on top. Complexity compounds as each system
        demands its own care. Data is locked behind proprietary formats and
        APIs. What should be durable infrastructure becomes an ongoing rental,
        expensive to run and hard to escape. This outcome isn&apos;t accidental,
        it&apos;s the result of incentives misaligned with the people building
        and operating systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Object storage changes what databases can be. It provides durability,
        availability, and scale as a primitive, removing the need to constantly
        manage replication, rebalance state, or recover fragile clusters. Most
        databases fail to take advantage of this because they were designed for
        a world where object storage didn&apos;t exist. OpenData is built for
        the world we have now: data lives directly in object storage, compute is
        decoupled and ephemeral, and readers and writers scale independently.
        The system is simpler because the foundation is simpler.
      </p>
      <p>
        OpenData is a collection of focused, object-store-native databases built
        on a shared core. Each database does one thing well, but all share the
        same storage substrate, configuration model, and operational
        patterns. Operating many feels like operating one. Data remains
        portable and accessible while costs remain transparent. OpenData is MIT
        licensed, with no vendor dependency and no middleman. Object storage
        changed the rules and OpenData is designed to live by them.
