          If databases are open source commodities, why can database vendors still charge
          80% margins? It's because running production database clusters requires
          specialized expertise. The cost of databases today is in the
          operations, not the code.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text mt-12 mb-4">1. Object storage is a new primitive</h2>

        <p>
          We can fix this imbalance. Thanks to object storage, we now have durable,
          globally addressable storage that makes radically simpler database architectures
          possible. S3, GCS, and Azure Blob provide 11 nines of durability, effectively
          infinite capacity, and pay-per-use pricing — all without operational overhead.
        </p>

        <p>
          This isn't just cheaper storage. It's a new architectural primitive. When your
          storage layer is durable, available, and infinite by default, the entire database
          design changes. Replication, failover, capacity planning — these become storage
          concerns, handled by cloud infrastructure instead of database operators.
        </p>

        {/* TODO: Expand with more specific examples of how object storage changes architecture */}

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text mt-12 mb-4">2. Focused databases beat monoliths</h2>

        <p>
          What's more, the work needed to use object storage optimally is substantially
          similar across modern databases. The write-ahead log, the compaction engine,
          the caching layer, the manifest system — it's the same problem solved slightly
          differently each time.
        </p>

        <p>
          OpenData leverages this insight to build multiple focused databases on a shared core.
          Each database does one thing well. A log is a log. A TSDB is a TSDB. A vector
          database is a vector database. But underneath, they share the same storage engine,
          the same operational model, the same tooling.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bespoke operational know-how disappears. Fewer people are needed to run many databases.
          Operational costs collapse.
        </p>

        {/* TODO: Expand with comparison to monolithic database approaches */}

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text mt-12 mb-4">3. Open source, open data</h2>

        <p>
          These designs should be open source. OpenData uses open data formats and MIT licensing
          so there is no vendor lock-in. Your data is stored in standard formats in your own
          object storage bucket. You own it. You can read it with any compatible tool.
        </p>

        <p>
          OpenData is a collection of databases designed natively for object storage.
          Each database is focused on one use case. All databases share:
